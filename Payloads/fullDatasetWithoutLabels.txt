A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. 
Very little music or anything to speak of.  	
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.

It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.

His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.

The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.

I don't think you will be disappointed.  	
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	
Too politically correct.  	
Very disappointing.  	
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.

Hitchcock is a great director.

Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.

Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	
<a href="\x06javascript:javascript:alert(1)" id="fuzzelement1">test</a>

Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	
When I first watched this movie, in the 8s, I loved it.  	
`"'><img src=xxx:x \x22onerror=javascript:alert(1)>
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	
`"'><img src=xxx:x \x0Bonerror=javascript:alert(1)>

You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.

If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	
"`'><script>\xE2\x80\x81javascript:alert(1)</script>

An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	
<frameset onload=javascript:alert(1)>
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.

I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!

the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.

Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".

I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.

An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.

STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.

The original Body and Soul (947) is a masterpiece.

He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.

Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-3 rating certainly won't allow.  	
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.

Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.

Don't miss it.  	
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.

The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	
The least said about the acting the better.  	
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.

Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  	
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.

This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.

However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  	
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (97) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.

It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.

It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.

Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.

All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.

As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.

The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.

Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.

How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.

Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.

You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	
The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	
Conclusion - I loved it.  	
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  	
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 2, 3, 4 years down the line.

It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  	
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.

Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!

If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!

It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	
&#060
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	
&#0060
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	
&#00060
&#000060
I rate this movie 9/.  	
&#0000060
&lt;
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	
&#x3c
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  	
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	
&#x03c
&#x003c
&#x0003c
This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	
&#x00003c
&#x000003c
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	
&#x3c;
&#x03c;
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	
&#x003c;
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  	
&#x0003c;
&#x00003c;
&#x000003c;
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	
&#X3c
Go rent it.  	
&#X03c
&#X003c
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	
Brilliance indeed.  	
&#X0003c
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	
&#X00003c
&#X000003c
Think of the film being like a dream.  	
&#X3c;
&#X03c;
Simply beautiful.  	
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	
&#X003c;
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	
&#X0003c;
&#X00003c;
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	
&#X000003c;
&#x3C
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	
&#x03C
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the "gadget".  	
I enjoyed it.  	
&#x003C
I have recommended it to friends.  	
&#x0003C
&#x00003C
&#x000003C
&#x3C;
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	
&#x03C;
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	
&#x003C;
Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  	
The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  	
&#x0003C;
The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  	
&#x00003C;
&#x000003C;
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	
&#X3C
&#X03C
&#X003C
&#X0003C
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  	
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  	
&#X00003C
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	
&#X000003C
&#X3C;
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	
&#X03C;
&#X003C;
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	
&#X0003C;
&#X00003C;
&#X000003C;
\x3c
\x3C
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	
\u003c
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 2th, 25) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!

This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.

Buy a different phone - but not this.	
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.	
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.

This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	
The instruction manual is lacking.

Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.

The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	
After charging overnight, these batteries work great.

A Disappointment.	
Its not user friendly.	
<style></style\x20<img src="about:blank" onerror=javascript:alert(1)//></style>
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.

This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	
This PDA rocks.	
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.

I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.	
I exchanged the sony ericson z5a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.

I was very impressed with the price of the cases.	
Also makes it easier to hold on to.
